Rabun Git has no public sign-up in the CLI. An admin creates a **user**, attaches that person’s **SSH public key**, then **grants a role** on each repository they should see. The website may offer invite-gated sign-up (`auth register`); that path never creates a forge admin.

This page is a set of workflows. Run `rabun-git …` on the server (operator, full access), over SSH if you are a forge admin, or from this machine after `rgit remote add origin git@git.example.com`:

```bash
rabun-git origin user list
# same as: ssh -p 2222 git@git.example.com user list
```

Examples use:

- `ada` — forge admin (already created in [Start the forge](/docs/start-the-forge/))
- `linus` — a teammate
- `ada/website` — a repository from [Set up a remote repository](/docs/remote-repository/)

## What a “user” is

A user is a login in `users.yaml` plus zero or more OpenSSH public keys in `keys/<login>.pub`. Git never asks for a password. When someone runs `ssh -p 2222 git@HOST` or `git push`, the forge looks up **which user owns that key**.

The SSH username can be:

- `git` (usual), or
- the forge login (`linus`)

If the username is anything else, authentication is rejected even if the key is registered.

Forge-wide **admin** (`--admin`) is a flag on the user, not a per-repo role. Forge admins skip per-repo ACL and can manage users and keys.

## Roles on a repository

Grant these with `rabun-git access grant`. Each higher role includes the one below it.

| Role | Clone / fetch | Push feature branches and tags | Open and review merge requests | Push `master` / `main` | Merge requests | Grant/revoke access on that repo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | yes | no | no | no | no | no |
| `write` | yes | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| `admin` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |

Also:

- **Forge admin** — everything above on every repo, plus `user` / `key` management.
- **Operator** — `rabun-git` run on the server; same power as a forge admin, no SSH.
- Creating a repo grants **admin** on that repo to the creator.

`master` and `main` are protected. Writers push other branches and use [merge requests](/docs/merge-requests/).

---

## Workflow: add a teammate who can push

Goal: `linus` can clone `ada/website`, push feature branches, and open merge requests. He cannot push `master` directly.

### 1. Create the user (not a forge admin)

On the server, as operator or forge admin:

```bash
rabun-git user add linus
rabun-git user list
```

`user add` with the same name again updates the admin flag (last write wins).

### 2. Register their public key

On **Linus’s machine**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "linus@git.example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy that one line to the server (file `linus.pub`) and **do not** copy the private key (`id_ed25519` without `.pub`).

The **first** key for a new user must be added by an operator or forge admin (Linus cannot SSH in yet). After that, he can append extra keys himself.

From this machine, over host SSH (port 22, needs sudo on the host):

```bash
rgit origin key copy linus --file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
rgit origin key list linus
```

On the server (or copy the `.pub` to the server):

```bash
rabun-git key add linus --file /path/to/linus.pub
rabun-git key list linus
```

From this machine, if you already have an admin key on port 2222, `--file` is read locally:

```bash
rgit origin key add linus --file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
rgit origin key list linus
```

`key list` prints fingerprints, not the key material. Only a forge admin can add keys for someone else.

### 3. Grant write on the repository

```bash
rabun-git access grant linus ada/website --role write
rabun-git repo show ada/website
```

`--role write` is the default if you omit `--role`.

Linus checks from his machine:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 git@git.example.com repo list
git clone ssh://git@git.example.com:2222/ada/website.git
```

He should see `ada/website` and the clone should succeed.

### 4. He pushes a branch (not `master`)

```bash
cd website
git checkout -b feature/readme
echo "Hello from linus" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Mention linus"
git push -u origin feature/readme
```

A direct `git push origin master` should be **rejected** until someone with repo `admin` (or a forge admin) merges a request.

---

## Workflow: read-only access (clone only)

A designer or CI mirror that must not push:

```bash
rabun-git user add pat
rabun-git key add pat --file /path/to/pat.pub
rabun-git access grant pat ada/website --role read
```

`pat` can `git clone` and `git fetch`. Push and merge requests fail with a need-`write` error.

---

## Workflow: make someone a repository admin

They need to merge requests and push `main`/`master`, but should not create forge users.

```bash
rabun-git access grant linus ada/website --role admin
```

Granting a new role **replaces** the previous role on that repo (write becomes admin). They can now:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 git@git.example.com request merge ada/website 1
ssh -p 2222 git@git.example.com access grant pat ada/website --role read
```

---

## Workflow: make someone a forge admin

They can create users, add keys for anyone, and bypass repo ACL.

```bash
rabun-git user add linus --admin
```

Same command as creating a user; existing `linus` is updated. To take forge admin away without deleting the account:

```bash
rabun-git user add linus
```

(omit `--admin`). Their per-repo roles in `access.yaml` still apply.

---

## Workflow: let a user create their own repos

Ordinary users may `repo create` only under **their** login:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 git@git.example.com repo create linus/notes
```

Linus becomes repo admin on `linus/notes`. Ada (forge admin) can still create `team/shared` for a group and grant people `write` or `admin` on it.

```bash
rabun-git repo create team/shared
rabun-git access grant ada team/shared --role admin
rabun-git access grant linus team/shared --role write
```

The operator/forge admin can create any `owner/name`. The `owner` segment does not have to be an existing user; it is just a path prefix (`team`, `ada`, `acme`).

---

## Workflow: revoke access or remove a person

Stop Linus from using `ada/website` (account stays; other repos unchanged):

```bash
rabun-git access revoke linus ada/website
rabun-git repo show ada/website
```

Remove the account, keys, and **all** repo grants:

```bash
rabun-git user remove linus
```

They can no longer authenticate. Repositories they owned remain on disk; grant someone else `admin` if the team still needs them.

---

## Who is allowed to run these commands

| Command | Operator on the server | Forge admin over SSH | Repo admin over SSH | The user themselves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user add` / `user list` / `user remove` | yes | yes | no | no |
| `key add` / `key list` for themselves | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `key add` / `key list` for someone else | yes | yes | no | no |
| `key copy` (this machine → host SSH) | yes (needs sudo on the host) | — | — | — |
| `access grant` / `revoke` on a repo | yes | yes | yes (that repo) | no |
| `repo create` `theirname/…` | yes | yes | if they are that user | yes |
| `repo create` `other/…` | yes | yes | no | no |

Commands that never work over SSH: `init`, `check`, `status`, `serve`, `key copy`. `key copy` runs on this machine and uses host SSH (port 22).

## Where this is stored

Under `$RABUN_GIT_ROOT`:

- `users.yaml` — login + forge admin flag
- `keys/<user>.pub` — public keys
- `access.yaml` — `owner/name` → user → `read` \| `write` \| `admin`

You can read those files; prefer `rabun-git user` / `key` / `access` so they stay valid YAML.
