[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) are the default. `rgit version` infers bumps, rewrites version files and `CHANGELOG.md`, and the forge can reject a push that breaks the rules.

Policy lives in the repo as `.rabun/version.toml`, next to [CI workflows](/docs/ci-workflows/). A release is one commit that updates every version file and the changelog; the annotated tag name must match those files.

These commands run on **this machine** (like `rgit view`). They are not available over SSH.

## Commands

```bash
rgit version show
rgit version check [RANGE]
rgit version bump [auto|patch|minor|major] [--to X.Y.Z] [--dry-run]
rgit version changelog [--from TAG]
rgit version release [auto|patch|minor|major] [--to X.Y.Z] [--dry-run] [--no-tag]
rgit version hook install
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `show` | Print the agreed version and the files that hold it |
| `check` | Require Conventional Commits in a range (default: last `v*` tag..`HEAD`) |
| `bump` | Rewrite version files only |
| `changelog` | Preview Keep a Changelog notes from commits |
| `release` | Bump files, rewrite `CHANGELOG.md`, `git add`, `chore(release): X.Y.Z`, annotated tag |
| `hook install` | Write `.git/hooks/commit-msg` so local commits are checked immediately |

`release` does not push and does not publish to crates.io or npm. Push the tag yourself when you are ready.

`auto` (the default for `bump` and `release`) looks at commits since the last version tag:

| Commits | SemVer bump |
| --- | --- |
| `feat:` | MINOR |
| `fix:` or `perf:` | PATCH |
| `!` after the type, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | MAJOR (`0.x` stays MINOR so you do not jump to 1.0.0 by accident) |
| `chore(release):`, merges, and other types | no bump |

Pass `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or `--to 1.2.3` to skip inference.

## Version files

`rgit version` detects these in the work tree root and keeps them in agreement:

| Kind | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Cargo | `Cargo.toml` (`[package].version` or `[workspace.package].version`), matching stanza in `Cargo.lock` |
| npm | `package.json`, top-level `version` in `package-lock.json` |
| Python | `pyproject.toml` (`[project].version` or `[tool.poetry].version`) |
| PHP | `composer.json` |
| Dart | `pubspec.yaml` |
| Helm | `Chart.yaml` (`version`, not `appVersion`) |
| Generic | `VERSION` or `version.txt` |

If two source files disagree, `show` / `bump` / `release` stop with an error.

## Policy file (default: on)

Commit this as `.rabun/version.toml`. That is the default this guide assumes — conventional messages, SemVer 2.0 tag names (`v1.2.3`), and version files that match the tag:

```toml
[version]
tag_prefix = "v"
changelog = "CHANGELOG.md"

[version.enforce]
commits = true
tags = true
manifests = true
```

`rgit version show`, `bump`, and `release` still work with no file. They always treat Conventional Commits as the bump schema and SemVer 2.0 as the version format. The forge gates run when this file is in the tree with `enforce` flags on.

| Flag | Gate |
| --- | --- |
| `commits` | New commits on a branch push must be Conventional Commits (merges and `Revert ` / `fixup!` are skipped) |
| `tags` | Tag names must be `{tag_prefix}` plus SemVer 2.0 (`v1.2.3`) |
| `manifests` | The tagged commit's version files must equal that SemVer (no `v` in the files) |

## Disable etiquette

Turn the forge gates off without deleting the rest of the file:

```toml
[version.enforce]
commits = false
tags = false
manifests = false
```

You can set only one flag to `false` (for example keep SemVer tags, allow any commit message). Omitting `.rabun/version.toml` has the same effect as all flags off: the forge will not reject ordinary commit messages or tags.

Skip `rgit version hook install` if you do not want a local `commit-msg` check. `git commit --no-verify` skips that hook. It cannot skip the forge `hooks/update` check while `enforce` is on.

Pass `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or `--to 1.2.3` to `rgit version bump` / `release` if you want a SemVer bump that does not follow the commits.

## Local hook vs forge gate

```bash
rgit version hook install
```

writes `.git/hooks/commit-msg` so `git commit` fails fast on this machine.

On the forge, the existing `hooks/update` script already calls `rgit hook update`. After you upgrade the forge binary, any repo that has committed `.rabun/version.toml` is gated on the next push. You do not re-install server hooks.

## Changelog

`release` uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). It keeps `## [Unreleased]`, inserts `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, maps `feat` → Added, `fix` → Fixed, and similar types to Changed / Removed / Security, and refreshes compare/tag footer links when it can see a GitHub-style repository URL (`origin` or `Cargo.toml` `repository`).

If `CHANGELOG.md` is missing, it is created.

## This project

This repository ships `.rabun/version.toml`. Cut a rabun-git release with:

```bash
rgit version release
git push origin HEAD --tags
```
