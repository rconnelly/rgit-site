`rabun-git` is a systemd unit plus a release archive on an **x86_64 (or aarch64) Ubuntu** host. The same machine can already run Rabun: this forge sits beside `rabun.service`, keeps settings in its own env file, and upserts `[[apps]]` in `/etc/rabun/rabun.toml`. The host never talks to GitHub. This machine (or Actions) packs or downloads the archive and copies it over SSH.

There is no public HTTP git UI and no Caddy virtual host. `serve` listens for git and management commands on **TCP 2222** and writes a loopback companion heartbeat.

## 1. Host

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. 1 vCPU / 1 GB is enough for hosting repositories; give the box more RAM if `.rabun/workflows` will compile code.

- SSH keys on the host (port 22) so `push.sh` can copy the archive
- **git** at runtime (bootstrap installs it). The host does **not** need `pkg-config` or a compiler unless you run CI workflows that need them
- Firewall: clients clone on **2222**, not 22

Do **not** `curl | bash` the bootstrap script from GitHub.

## 2. Bootstrap (once)

From a clone on this machine (`gh auth login` if you have not already). Pack this checkout and install in one step. SSH is **publickey only** (no sshd password prompt): use the account you already `ssh` to with a key, not `root@HOST` unless that key is in root’s `authorized_keys`.

```bash
./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --pack --bootstrap user@HOST
```

`--identity FILE` (or `RABUN_GIT_SSH_IDENTITY`) selects a private key. After login, install still needs root: passwordless sudo runs with no prompt; otherwise one **sudo** password (not SSH).

`--env` is optional. If you pass it, the file is copied to **`/etc/rabun-git/rabun-git.env`** (0640). That is the correct place for `RABUN_GIT_ROOT` and bind overrides — not `/etc/rabun/rabun.env`.

First-time from a GitHub Release (latest stable if you omit the tag):

```bash
./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --bootstrap user@HOST
```

`--pack` needs **pkg-config**, a C compiler, git, and Cargo (`./scripts/install-linux-build-deps.sh`). It names the archive with `git describe --tags --always --dirty` unless you pass a tag. Combine `--pack` with `--bootstrap` for a first-time host from this checkout.

After bootstrap, register the first admin from this machine (host SSH + sudo) or in an operator session on the host. Files under `/var/lib/rabun-git` must stay owned by `rabun-git`.

From this machine:

```bash
rgit remote add origin git@HOST
rgit origin key copy ada --admin --file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
rgit origin repo create ada/website
```

On the host:

```bash
rabun-git shell          # or: sudo rabun-git shell
rabun-git user add ada --admin
rabun-git key add ada --file /path/to/ada.pub
rabun-git repo create ada/website
exit
```

`rabun-git shell` runs one `sudo` as the `rabun-git` user, then an interactive bash. The prompt is `(rabun-git) … $` for the whole session; `exit` ends it. Mutating commands (`user`, `key`, `repo`, …) refuse to run as your login user so the service does not lose write access.

`rabun-git check` and `rabun-git status` still work outside the session. After the first admin key is registered, this machine can create more repos without sudo: `rgit origin repo create ada/website` or `ssh -p 2222 git@HOST repo create ada/website`. `key add --file` on the host still needs a path there; from this machine, `--file` is read locally. `key copy` always uses host SSH (port 22), not git port 2222.

`rabun-git` loads `/etc/rabun-git/rabun-git.env`, so you do not need to pass `--config` when that file sets `RABUN_GIT_CONFIG`.

Open **TCP 2222** if clients are not on the same machine. If `ufw` is already active, bootstrap allows 2222. To enable ufw from scratch: `RABUN_GIT_ENABLE_UFW=1 ./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --pack --bootstrap user@HOST`.

## 3. Later deploys

After bootstrap, pack current `master` (or a dirty tree) and `scp` it:

```bash
./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --pack user@HOST
```

Two-step (inspect the archive first):

```bash
./deploy/ubuntu/pack.sh
# dist/release/rabun-git-<git-describe>-<triple>.tar.gz
./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --archive dist/release/rabun-git-<git-describe>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz user@HOST
```

GitHub Release deploys are unchanged: omit `--pack` and `push.sh` downloads the latest stable tarball (or a tag you pass). `--pack` and `--archive` cannot be used together.

Refresh the env file without rewriting the example:

```bash
./deploy/ubuntu/push.sh --pack --env .env user@HOST
```

## Layout on the host

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/local/bin/rabun-git` | released binary |
| `/usr/local/bin/rgit` | symlink to `rabun-git` (skipped if a foreign `rgit` already exists) |
| `/etc/rabun-git/rabun-git.env` | `RABUN_GIT_ROOT`, optional bind overrides |
| `/etc/rabun-git/rabun-git.toml` | env var names (not tokens) |
| `/var/lib/rabun-git` | forge root (`users.yaml`, `keys/`, `repos/`, `runs/`) |
| `/var/lib/rabun-git/status.json` | Companion heartbeat (`rabun.companion/v1`) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/rabun-git.service` | `serve` (git SSH `0.0.0.0:2222`, loopback `GET /health` on `127.0.0.1:8792`) |
| `/etc/rabun/rabun.toml` | Rabun app manifest (`[[apps]] name = "git"`) |

The systemd user is `rabun-git`. Git clients still connect as `git@HOST` on port **2222** (russh; not the unix user). Admin SSH on port 22 is unchanged.

Logs: `journalctl -u rabun-git -f`. Heartbeat: `rabun-git status` or `curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8792/health`. If `rabun-feeds` already uses `8792` on the same host, set `RABUN_GIT_HEALTH_BIND` to another loopback port. Audit sandboxing with `systemd-analyze security rabun-git`. There is still no public HTTP git UI.

Clone URL after DNS points at the host:

```text
ssh://git@HOST:2222/owner/name.git
```

## Housekeeping

Every install:

- Refreshes `rabun-git.service` and restarts the unit
- Upserts Rabun’s app manifest (`name = "git"`, `command = "rabun-git"`, `args = ["serve"]`, `health_url`, `status_file`)
- Leaves warehouse, feeds, and other `[[apps]]` blocks alone
- Leaves `/etc/rabun/rabun.toml` alone when Rabun is not installed
- Does **not** overwrite an existing env file unless you pass `--env`

`rabun list` / `rabun run git` read that manifest after Rabun restarts. This forge still runs on its own unit; do not also `rabun run git` on the same host unless you stop the systemd service.
